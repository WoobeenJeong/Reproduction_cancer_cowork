### [Contents in main code]
* Each file numbered from 1 to 9 covers the following topics:

> 001: Setting up the environment for GPU
> 
> 002: Data preprocessing and error handling
>
> 003: WSI image patching
>
> 004: Quality check for patched data
>
> 005: Quality check for omics data
>
> 006: Trimming WSI images
>
> 007: (Go to the figure_code directory to run each analysis)
>
> 008: Survival analysis comparing risk vs. non-risk groups
>
> 009: SHAP calculation after analysis of WSI and omics data
